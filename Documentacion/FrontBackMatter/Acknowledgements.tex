\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish first of all to thank the members of the Staff of the Italian \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} User Group, in particular Prof.~Enrico Gregorio, for their invaluable aid during the writing of this work, the detailed explanations, the patience and the precision in the suggestions, the supplied solutions, the competence and the kindness. Thanks also to all the people who have discussed with me on the forum of the Group, prodigal of precious observations and good advices.

Finally, thanks to André Miede, for his wonderful ClassicThesis style, and to Daniel Gottschlag, who gave to me the hint for this original reworking.
